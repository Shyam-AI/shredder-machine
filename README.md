# shredder-machine

Note that this not the original version of the code. This repo has the software implementation of the same application.

# Problem statement : To stop the shredder machine as soon as hand crosses a specified mark in order to prevent injuries to the operators' hands handling the shredder machine.
Note : Sensors like obstacle detecting sensor or PIR sensor could have been used. But sensors fail to classify between a hand and the garbage thus is not a practical solution for        the same.
Thus computer vision comes into the rescue where we can build hand detection model which detects hand and as soon as the hand crosses a specified mark.
